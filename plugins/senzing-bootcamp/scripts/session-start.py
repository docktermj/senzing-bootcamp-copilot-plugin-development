"""sessionStart hook: to resume an in-progress bootcamp by injecting resume context.

Also folds any in-progress module recap checkpoint into docs/bootcamp_recap.md on
resume, so a module that was interrupted (quit / compaction / prior session) keeps
its in-progress narrative in the recap (see recap_checkpoint.py).

A finished bootcamp is checked first (#905): when ``bootcamp_complete`` is true in the
progress file or in the preferences (``module_start_apparatus.bootcamp_complete()``), the
hook makes no resume offer, folds no checkpoint and adds no apparatus reminder. It tells the
guide to follow the finished case of ``bootcamp-onboarding/SKILL.md`` step 2 instead: say the
bootcamp is complete, name ``the package-bootcamp skill`` and ask what they would like to explore. That
holds even when the progress file is missing or malformed, because a finished project must
never read as a fresh bootcamp and run onboarding again. The message is ASCII-only, like the
reminder, so a Windows console code page cannot break it.

Cross-platform: invoked as a ``type: command`` hook whose ``command`` names the
interpreter and this script, quoted (``python3 "<path>"``), per INV-052. Python is already a hard bootcamp dependency (the graduation recap PDF always
runs under python3; the Truth Set visualization server also does when the chosen language is
Python).
